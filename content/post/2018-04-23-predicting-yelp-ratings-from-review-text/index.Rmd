Hello again! If you've been following along you'll know that I'm in the middle of a series of posts
digging through Yelp review data. Last time I went through some exploratory analysis of Yelp reviews
and tried to get an understanding of the text that goes into them. My followup is to build
a model to predict those Yelp ratings from the review text itself. Unfortunately, I did this building
in Python so I ended up putting it on Kaggle instead of directly on my R site. Luckily, it's just a [single
click away](https://www.kaggle.com/athoul01/predicting-yelp-ratings-from-review-text/notebook)! 
So if you are curious about building a neural network NLP model to predict Yelp reviews, head
on over and take a look.

Up next I'll take on deploying this Keras model.
