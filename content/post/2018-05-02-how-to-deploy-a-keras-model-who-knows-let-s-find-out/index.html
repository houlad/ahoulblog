<p>Over the past couple weeks, Iâ€™ve been playing around with the Yelp academic <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">dataset</a>.
The <a href="https://www.ahoulette.com/2018/04/11/reviewing-yelp/">first</a> thing I did was explore the dataset to see what
interesting tidbits jumped out. I ended up focusing on the text of the individual reviews. There were
identifiable differences in the text of, for instance, 1 and 5 star reviews so my next step was seeing
if I could use this information to predict ratings. My second <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/athoul01/predicting-yelp-ratings-from-review-text">post</a>
with the Yelp dataset built a recurrent neural network that uses the text of a review to predict
what rating that person gave the restaurant. I ended up with a model that was nearly 90% accurate. Considering
there are 5 classes to choose from, this result made me pretty happy.</p>
<p>My next step was inevitableâ€“I needed to deploy this model somewhere and create a test application. This is easily the
most intimidating step for me. Iâ€™m pretty comfortable using R to deploy Shiny apps, but otherwise, my knowledge in the
area is really limited. I built my model in Python using Keras, so that meant I would need to deploy it within
the Python framework. This is something Iâ€™ve never done before, but Iâ€™ve never let not knowing something stop
me before!</p>
<p>After a lot of research and frustration Iâ€™ve finally got something up and running. Itâ€™s by no means pretty, but
as a proof of concept I think it will work just fine. Iâ€™d love to hear some feedback or see some examples of
how people are quickly deploying Keras/tensorflow (or more generally just python models) models. Iâ€™m not particularly
happy with how mine turned out, but I set a time limit for myself on this project and for now it will have to do. With
all that said, letâ€™s take a look and see how I approached deploying my Yelp app.</p>
<div id="frameworks-frameworks-everywhere" class="section level2">
<h2>Frameworks, frameworks everywhere!</h2>
<p>If you are a web developer, Iâ€™d imagine that the plethora of frameworks out there is a blessing. Thereâ€™s Django, TurboGears,
Flask, and CherryPy just to name a few. I donâ€™t need anything fancy here, so I initially settled on the micro framework
Flask. There are plenty of <a href="https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html">posts</a> out
there detailing how to setup a flask API for a keras model, but I would still have to deal with setting up the
frontend of the framework. I didnâ€™t want to worry about html files or anything of the sort. Thankfully, I stumbled upon
<a href="https://plot.ly/products/dash/">Dash</a>. Dash is built ontop of React and Flask and is essentially Shiny but for Python.
Itâ€™s made to be a simple framework for analytical web apps and it was, personally, the easiest system to get up and
running. Dash seems to be focused on deploying visualizations, but it was simple enough to deploy a machine learning
model instead. Just keep in mind that my toy example is by no means all that Dash is capable of. You can easily use
it to build production ready visualizations with minimal effort.</p>
</div>
<div id="building-the-app" class="section level2">
<h2>Building the app</h2>
<p>Dash allows you to get started super fast with just a single file containing everything needed to run the app locally.
You can modularize the code just like you would with Flask, but I didnâ€™t think it was necessary and I definitely
wanted to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>First things first, I need to import my dependencies. The Dash dependencies are just the various
widgets necessary to build the front and back end and the documentation is pretty clear <a href="https://dash.plot.ly/">here</a>.
Iâ€™ll also need to import various keras components so I can load my trained neural network and preprocess new text.
An important point here is that you need your <em>.h5</em> file containing model weights and structure from keras, but you also
need your tokenizer that you used in training. This is saved with pickle. You can technically create a new tokenizer
without this file, but my model predictions were totally off when I did this.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Dash dependencies
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output, State

#Model dependencies
import numpy as np
from keras.models import load_model
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
import pickle</code></pre>
<p>Next, I instantiate the app and the server as done below.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>app = dash.Dash(__name__)
server = app.server</code></pre>
<p>Now I need to create a couple functions that do the necessary loading and data prep.</p>
<p>The first function, <strong><em>load_models</em></strong>, reads in both the trained neural network model
and also the tokenizer. I go ahead and load these models right away.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def load_models():
    # Load my pre-trained Keras model
    global model, tokenizer
    model = load_model(&#39;yelp_nn_model.h5&#39;)
    # load my original tokenizer used to build model
    with open(&#39;keras_tokenizer.pickle&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as f:
        tokenizer = pickle.load(f)
    return model, tokenizer

model, tokenizer = load_models()</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>prepare_text</em></strong> does the preprocessing work of converting the input string into a sequence
of numbers and then padding that sequence so it is the same length as all the others.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def prepare_text(text):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Need to Tokenize text and pad sequences&#39;&#39;&#39;
    words = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(text)
    words_padded = pad_sequences(words, maxlen = 200)

    return words_padded</code></pre>
<p>Next comes building the front end layout for your app. This can be as simple or as complex as you want.
You can build really pretty interactive visualizations like this Uber <a href="https://dash-uber-rides.plot.ly/">graphic</a>
or you can do something simple just to get a proof of concept up and running. Iâ€™m just setting up a couple
markdown based descriptor lines and then a simple text input box and submit button. Ugly, but it kinda works. I know
you all want me to design your next website! ðŸ˜„</p>
<pre class="python"><code>app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1(&quot;Restaurant Review Predictions&quot;),   
    html.H3(&quot;Enter the text of a restaurant review and I&#39;ll predict what I think it&#39;s star rating is!&quot;),
    dcc.Markdown(&#39;&#39;&#39;For more on the model generating the predictions, visit
     [here](https://www.kaggle.com/athoul01/predicting-yelp-ratings-from-review-text). To learn about the data set
     check out my blog [post](https://www.ahoulette.com/2018/04/11/reviewing-yelp/)&#39;&#39;&#39;),
    dcc.Markdown(&#39;&#39;&#39;Powered by data from the [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge) academic data set&#39;&#39;&#39;),
    dcc.Textarea(id = &#39;review&#39;, value = &#39;&#39;, style={&#39;width&#39;: &#39;100%&#39;, &#39;rows&#39;: &#39;5&#39;}),
    html.Button(id = &#39;submit-button&#39;, n_clicks = 0, children = &#39;Submit&#39;),
    html.Div(id=&#39;output-state&#39;)
])</code></pre>
<p>I donâ€™t know html very well at all, but setting up a basic layout is pretty easy using just a handful of
elements and attributes. The dash-core-components(dcc) are where you specify most of the interactivity that
you want to include in your app. Here I just have a big box to input text, but this is also where youâ€™d find
sliders, dropdown menus, etc.</p>
<p>All thatâ€™s left is to setup the interactivity in the app. I will be inputting a review as a string of text.
I will need to take this text, process it, feed it into my model for a prediction and then return
the predicted rating. All this is done below.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>@app.callback(Output(&#39;output-state&#39;, &#39;children&#39;),
    [Input(&#39;submit-button&#39;, &#39;n_clicks&#39;)],   
    [State(&#39;review&#39;, &#39;value&#39;)])
def predict_text(submit, review):
    if review is not None and review is not &#39;&#39;:
        try:
            clean_text = prepare_text([review])
            preds = model.predict(clean_text)
            #return &#39;This review sounds like a {} star review.&#39;.format(np.argmax(preds, axis = 1)[0] + 1)
            return &#39;This review sounds like a {0} star review. I am {1:.2f}% confident.&#39;.format(np.argmax(preds, axis = 1)[0] + 1,
                np.max(preds, axis = 1)[0]*100)
        except ValueError as e:
            print(e)
            return &quot;Unable to predict rating.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Dash has a special python decorator <strong><em>@app.callback</em></strong> that handles all of this. I describe my application
by linking the components by their id. The review text I input into the <strong><em>dcc.Textarea</em></strong> has an id of <em>review</em>.
I want to grab the <em>value</em> of this input so I have a State object with an id of <em>review</em> that grabs that <em>value</em> property
of that component. I can now access that review text. I use <strong><em>State</em></strong> instead of <strong><em>Input</em></strong> so that the app
waits to predict until the whole review is entered and I click submit.</p>
<p>This is also where I define my <strong><em>predict_text</em></strong> function that will take the review
text and run it through the prediction pipeline. First it
processes the raw data. Then it runs the predict method from the keras model on the clean text. And finally
it returns the predicted rating. Iâ€™ve also set it up to return the probability rating as a measure of
confidence in the prediction.</p>
<p>The last thing you need is just a call to start the app. There is some issue with tensorflow where
because of the way async events are handled you get an error when calling your predict functions.
Itâ€™s described in detail <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/2397">here</a>. I used the workaround
of setting debug and threaded to False and it seemed to solve the issue.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    app.run_server(debug=False, threaded = False)</code></pre>
<p>Thatâ€™s all the code needed to run this app locally. You can see it all in one place on my <a href="https://github.com/Grollus/Yelp/blob/master/dash_app.py">github</a>.
If you want to run it, you just need to run <em>python dash_app.py</em> in the working directory.</p>

<div id="deploying-to-the-public" class="section level2">
<h2>Deploying to the public</h2>
<p>After testing locally, I finally had a working application that I was ready to deploy. Here is where
Dash really set itself apart. I could simply follow their deployment <a href="https://dash.plot.ly/deployment">guide</a>
for heroku and be done with it. The basic steps were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new environment and folder for all app files.</li>
<li>Set up a new git for said files.</li>
<li>Put a .gitignore, Procfile, requirements.txt file and app.py file into said folder. Procfile is basically just a one
line file that launches your app.</li>
<li>Initialize a <a href="heroku.com">heroku</a> app, add all the files to git and commit/push.</li>
<li>Voila!</li>
</ul>
<p>So good news is that it really was as easy as the guide made it out to be. I had to setup a heroku
account, but that was really simple. Bad news is that, well, my app is really slow and Iâ€™m not entirely sure
why. Locally the thing runs instantly, but the heroku version is slow both to startup and when generating predictions.
After some digging Iâ€™ve figured out a couple things.</p>
<p>First, Herokuâ€™s free tier auto-sleeps an app after 30 minutes. That means that pretty much everytime someone
wants to access your app, it has to go through the whole boot process. In this case, that means starting up
the tensorflow backend, loading the models and loading some pretty hefty packages. This was taking upwards of
a minute when I was testing things out. My slug size for the deployed app was decently sized (~250MB), but that
didnâ€™t exceed the slug softcap size of 500MB. My saved neural net alone is ~50MB, so I donâ€™t know how small
I could even make my heroku slug. Ultimately, Iâ€™m not sure if the free tier on heroku is the problem
or if I need to cut the app down to size/load things more efficiently. Iâ€™d love to hear
some suggestions.</p>
<p>Second, the bigger problemâ€“I think, at leastâ€“is a pesky <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-codes#r14-memory-quota-exceeded">R14</a>
memory error. The free tier launches a dyno that has 512MB of memory. After monitoring my logs, I figured that my app
was consistently using over 600MB. Perhaps more worryingly, that number seemed to creep up. So I figure I
have a memory leak in there somewhere, but, again, Iâ€™m not sure.</p>
<p>The R14 error is troublesome both for stability of my app and also for performance reasons. If the app took a while to
load, but then was snappy to predict I wouldnâ€™t care that much. But it can take upwards of 10 seconds to spit
out a prediction, which is just unnacceptable. This would, obviously, never work in production. According to
heroku, if you exceed the memory quota, you end up using disk swap which is very slow. Ultimately, I think the predictions
are slow for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One, the app simply requires more than 512MB of memory. When I run things locally, the app is using about 600MB
of memory too. I believe this means Iâ€™d need to break my app into separate components to improve performanceâ€“
or deploy it on a more powerful tier of server.</p></li>
<li><p>Two, there is something in the way Iâ€™ve setup the app that results in a minor memory leak over time. While I
donâ€™t think this is the primary issue at the moment, if I ever wanted to put this into production for
real, Iâ€™d have to run a memory profiler and see where Iâ€™ve gone wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the time being Iâ€™m going to leave things as they are, but Iâ€™d really love to hear suggestions on how youâ€™d
deploy a model like this. All the codeâ€“including the keras modelâ€“ are in this <a href="https://github.com/Grollus/Yelp">repo</a>
so it should be easy enough to try out your own deployment methods if you are interested. If you do so, just message
me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Adam_Houl">twitter</a> or leave a comment about how you did it.</p>

<div id="wrapup" class="section level2">
<h2>Wrapup</h2>
<p>As usual with stuff like this, Iâ€™ve learned a ton about what I donâ€™t know! Web development definitely has a
lot of nuance and working with such a large technical debt makes things challenging. Luckily, I can deploy
most of the models I build with Shiny, and for the time being Dash will work well enough anytime I need
to use Python. But this was good practice and will definitely help when I have to hand over a model to
another engineer for them to deploy. For now you can visit the barebones app <a href="my-reviews-app.herokuapp.com">here</a>.
Remember, I know itâ€™s slow, but if you are patient you can get some really solid review predictions from it!</p>
